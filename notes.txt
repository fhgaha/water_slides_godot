Jitspoe's brick shader: https://github.com/godotengine/godot-proposals/issues/8671

Maybe
+ amnt should depend on tube length
- control points scaling should depend on tube length
- generate tube edge transparent thing for interaction


Noted
- should not change segment positions, only start and end positions i guess

Issues
- spawned tubes are generated 4 times. no good. @export gets called on node creation i guess
